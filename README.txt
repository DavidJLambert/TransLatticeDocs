AUTHOR:
	David J. Lambert

SUMMARY:
	Documentation I wrote while employed at TransLattice, Inc.
	https://github.com/DavidJLambert/TransLatticeDocs

	TransLattice wrote a distributed database named the "TransLattice Elastic Database", based on PostgreSQL.
	This database was released as the open-source project Postgres-XL (www.postgres-xl.org).

	TransLattice also developed the "TransLattice Automation Kit", an API for the TransLattice Elastic Database.

DATE:
	2012 and 2013

PURPOSE:
	A sample of the author's documentation.

DESCRIPTION:
	README.txt (this file).
	Directory "All Mine" contains documents that were written entirely by me:
		"Talend Open Studio for the TransLattice Elastic Database.pdf"
		"TransLattice Automation Kit 2.0 User Guide.pdf"
	Directory "Mostly Mine" contains documentation written mostly by me:
		"tak_sample.py" (a Jython script for exercising the "TransLattice Automation Kit")
		"nodeinfo.py" (a Jython script imported by tak_sample.py).
		"TransLattice Application Platform Info and Troubleshooting.pdf"
	TransLatticeDocs.zip is a zip file containing all the files above (for your convenience).
